# Applesoft-BASIC-to-py

A translation of the DEMOS Basic file available @ <https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/> into python
We're trying to make it as accurate as possible with a few exceptions (like to make stuff actually work or to make it a little better).
This means that somthing that uses a basic feature that isn't in python (that we know of) it just prints the same text as it would in the demo.
